# Documenting a Resource
This is a glossary of fields used by the data resource descriptor file convention of the (Re)usable Data Project.
A [template file](../data-sources/source.template) is provided to assist with this process, and this documentation
mirrors the description of these fields as they appear on reusabledata.org data source detail pages.

## id
### Field Description
Unique ID of the resource, biodbcore or NAR preferred. But any unique internal ID is usable.
This is a short-form identifier (often an initialism) for the resource created by the curator. By convention, this
is typically the same as the file prefix describing the resource. Dashes are used in lieu of spaces when needed.

### Example Values
civicdb, bgee, mgi, monarch, pmkb, ncbi-gene

## description
### Field Description
A full description of the resource from the resource itself, if possible.

### Example Value
'Integrate, align, and re-distribute cross-species gene, genotype, variant, disease, and phenotype data. 
Provide a portal for exploration of phenotype-based similarity. Facilitate identification of animal models 
of human disease through phenotypic similarity. Enable quantitative comparison of cross-species phenotypes. 
Develop embeddable widgets for data exploration. Influence genotype and phenotype reporting standards. 
Improve ontologies to better curate genotype-phenotype data.'

## last-curated
### Field Description
(Optional) The ISO 8601 date of when the resource was last curated.

### Example Value
'2017-12-03'

## source
### Field Description

### Example Value
'National Center for Biotechnology Information (Gene)'

## source-link

  * _Unknown:_ Used when a resource does not strictly qualify for only one of the above types.

## status
### Field Description
Whether or not annotation is complete on this resource. (Also described as *Curation status* in
the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Allowed Values
Current allowable entries are: "complete", "incomplete", and "nonpublic".

## data-field
### Field Description
The area of research for the resource. (Also described as *Field* in the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Example Values
biomedical, biology, pharmacology

## data-type
### Field Description
The type of data the resource contains. (Also described as *Type* in the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Example Values
human, x-species, cross-species, ontology, MOD, genomic resource, pathway, sequence

## data-categories
### Field Description
(Optional) Tags to describe the resource and its data. (Also described as *Categories* in
the reusabledata.org source details view)
