# Documenting a Resource
This is a glossary of fields used by the data resource descriptor file convention of the (Re)usable Data Project.
A [template file](../data-sources/source.template) is provided to assist with this process, and this documentation
mirrors the description of these fields as they appear on reusabledata.org data source detail pages.

## id
### Field Description
Unique ID of the resource, biodbcore or NAR preferred. But any unique internal ID is usable.
This is a short-form identifier (often an initialism) for the resource created by the curator. By convention, this
is typically the same as the file prefix describing the resource. Dashes are used in lieu of spaces when needed.

### Example Values
`civicdb`, `bgee`, `mgi`, `monarch`, `pmkb`, `ncbi-gene`

## description
### Field Description
A full description of the resource from the resource itself, if possible.

### Example Value
'Integrate, align, and re-distribute cross-species gene, genotype, variant, disease, and phenotype data. 
Provide a portal for exploration of phenotype-based similarity. Facilitate identification of animal models 
of human disease through phenotypic similarity. Enable quantitative comparison of cross-species phenotypes. 
Develop embeddable widgets for data exploration. Influence genotype and phenotype reporting standards. 
Improve ontologies to better curate genotype-phenotype data.'

## last-curated
### Field Description
(Optional) The ISO 8601 date of when the license was last reviewed by a (Re)Usable Data Project curator.

### Example Value
`2017-12-03`

## source
### Field Description
A full-length, human-readable name for the resource.

### Example Value
`National Center for Biotechnology Information (Gene)`

## source-link
### Field Description
URL for the resource. (Also described as *Location* in the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Example Value
`http://www.civicdb.org`

## source-type
### Field Description
(Optional) How the resource relates to the data it contains. 
  
### Allowed Values
Current allowable entries are: `unknown`, `repository`, `source`, and `integrator`.
  * _Repository:_ Describes a resource that allows contributors to directly submit datasets.
  * _Source:_ Describes a primary source of data or knowledge generated by the source.
  * _Integrator:_ Describes a resource that collects and harmonizes content from multiple other sources.
  * _Unknown:_ Used when a resource does not strictly qualify for only one of the above types.

## status

the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Allowed Values
Current allowable entries are: `complete`, `incomplete`, and `nonpublic`.

## data-field
### Field Description
The area of research for the resource. (Also described as *Field* in the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Example Values
`biomedical`, `biology`, `pharmacology`

## data-type
### Field Description
The type of data the resource contains. (Also described as *Type* in the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Example Values
`human`, `x-species`, `cross-species`, `ontology`, `MOD`, `genomic resource`, `pathway`, `sequence`

## data-categories
### Field Description
(Optional) Tags to describe the resource and its data. (Also described as *Categories* in
the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Example Values
`cancer`, `precision medicine`, `variants`, `variant disease associations`

## data-access
### Field Description
(Optional) Links to the resource's data.

### Example Values
```YAML
- type: download
  location: https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/releases
- type: api
  location: https://griffithlab.github.io/civic-api-docs/
```

## license
### Field Description
The license that is used by the resource. We use [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) where we can or: 
`inconsistent`, `public domain`, `unlicensed`, `all rights reserved`, or `custom`.

### Example Values
`CC0-1.0`, `CC-BY-4.0`, `custom`

## license-type
### Field Description
The type of license that is being used. This will be to define compatible data pools in the future; 
we only use the grossest terms now. If it is not known "unknown" is used. 

### Allowed Values
Current possible values are: `unknown`, `unlicensed`, `copyleft`, `permissive`, `public domain`, 
`copyright`, `restrictive`, or `private pool`.

`http://www.omim.org/help/agreement`, `http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/inc/legal.inc.php`

## license-hat-used
### Field Description
(Optional) Setting this flag to true indicates that the licensing was combinatorially complicated 
enough (as is the case in some commercial licenses) that the curator chose to wear a single "hat" 
during the process. From the site text: "While we try to cover as much of the licensing 
possibilities of a data resource that we can, in a few cases we may choose a particular "hat" to 
wear while evaluating to prevent a combinatorial explosion, which may also reduce the clarity of 
our curations for the community. In these cases, we may take on the role of a (1) non-commercial 
(2) academic (3) group that is (4) based in the US and trying to (5) create an aggregating 
resource, noting that other entities may have different results in the license commentary."
(Also described as *Focused curation* in the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Allowed Values
`true`, `false`

## license-issues
### Field Description
(Optional) Structured issues with the license. For every issue discovered with a resource, there 
should be a corresponding item in the license-issues field that marks the /exact/ violation, along 
with any comments. This field can be used by resources as the first step to improvement, as well 
as clarify any surrounding circumstances. Any issues or thoughts about a resource that do not slot 
into one of the criteria violations can go into the license-commentary field.
(Also described as *Issues* in the reusabledata.org source details view)

### Allowed Values
`A.1.1`, `A.1.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.2`, `B.1`, `B.2.1`, `B.2.2`, `C.1`, `C.2`,

## license-commentary
### Field Description

"license-commentary":
  - "one thought"
  - "another thought"
```

## was-controversial
### Field Description
(Optional) Marker noting that there was some extended internal discussion or controversy about 
the evaluation of the licensing terms. If this is marked at "true", the controversy, or a link 
to a permanent archive of the controversy, must be sufficiently contained in the 
"license-commentary" to reconstruct the issues.

### Allowed Values
`true`, `false`

 - label: 'Rhea development and curation activities at the SIB are supported by the Swiss Federal 
 Government through the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), and by 
 the SystemsX.ch, The Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology.'
