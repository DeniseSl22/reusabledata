license-issues:
  - criteria: A.2
    comment: "The licensing uses custom verbiage, as well as being somewhat hidden. See commentary."
  - criteria: E.1.1
    comment: "The license distinguishes groups, allowing for free use in research and education. There is no statement for other groups."
license-commentary:
  - 'The license information found was in passing in the "About SGD" paragraph on the SGD Help page at https://sites.google.com/view/yeastgenome-help/about; in its entirety: "...all of the data in SGD are freely accessible to researchers and educators worldwide..."'
  - "Otherwise, a reasonable person might assume that the licensing terms were those of Stanford's Terms of Use (https://www.stanford.edu/site/terms/), linked on most pages and considerably more restrictive."
