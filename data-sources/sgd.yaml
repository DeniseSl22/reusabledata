    comment: "While the downloadable data seems quite clearly CC-BY-4.0, the API terms footer indicates no redistribution under similar terms (with an implication that abstracts may be under other copyright restrictions as well), with a punt-to-user disclaimer."
license-commentary:
  - 'The license information found was in passing in the "About SGD" paragraph on the SGD Help page at https://sites.google.com/view/yeastgenome-help/about; in its entirety: "...all of the data in SGD are freely accessible to researchers and educators worldwide..."'
  - "SGD operates under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0)."
  - 'However, the license information for the API is much less clear, reading: "Permission to use the information contained in this database was given by the researchers/institutes who contributed or published the information. Users of the database are solely responsible for compliance with any copyright restrictions, including those applying to the author abstracts."'
