license-commentary:
  - 'The entirety of the license appears to be: "No restrictions, all public data from ArrayExpress can be used by anyone and our services are completely free of charge."'
  - 'Otherwise, ArrayExpress seems to defer its licensing and ToS to the EBI terms; e.g.: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use; while these are similarly permissive, we take the ArrayExpress terms at face value.'
  - 'While there are distinctions occasionally made between "private" and "public" data, it seems that "private" is just staging data before publication and does not affect evaluation.'
  - 'There is an interesting section (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/help/data_availability.html#removal) that describes situations where data needs to be retracted. This section, while alarmingly titled, is has no effect on the license determination.'
