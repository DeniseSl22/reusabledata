      comment: 'Agreement section 13 requires downloads to be updated by downstream; section 14 discussion arbitrary API key revocation.'
    - criteria: C.2
      comment: 'Downloads and access are provided post-registration; as the API key is used for access control, it violates the C.2 example.'
    - criteria: D.1.2
      comment: 'Sections 8, 9, and 10 of the agreement make it seems that while a non-profit reasearcher may access the data, there is no reuse (pass-through) possible.'

license-commentary:
    - 'Assuming that one registered, it seems that data access would be relatively pain-free; so no C.1 violation.'
    - 'See also: https://omim.org/downloads and https://omim.org/api for additional access information.'
    - 'It is worth reading through the linked agreement; there are many sections that are restrictive or would be best interpreted with legal advice.'
