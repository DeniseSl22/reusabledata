    comment: 'While any novel data is under a CC license, the integrated resources are under whatever license the upstream is, with the user expected to sort it out.'
license-commentary:
  - 'Unfortunately, the API ToS link leads to a bad (404-type) Swagger page.'
  - 'From the license page: \"Please note that TCRD incoporates many data sources with a variety of associated licenses...Users of the TCRD downloads are resposible for compliance with these licenses.\"'
  - 'Given the variety and terms of the upstream resources, the inconsistency is not unexpected.'
  - 'The license is also found here at https://pharos.nih.gov/idg/about, which has similar wording to the README on the downloads page, but makes no note of the user responsibility to adhere to licenses from original data sources.'
