license-issues:
    - criteria: A.2
      comment: "For our use case (see commentary), KEGG (FTP) uses custom licensing through NPO Bioinformatics Japan (https://www.bioinformatics.jp/en/keggftp.html)."
    - criteria: B.1
      comment: 'According to the organizational use agreement: "Your Product or Service must not allow Your users to obtain KEGG FTP Data, except in small quantities"; many uses would require negotiation here as continuing reuse is unclear.'
    - criteria: D.1.2
      comment: 'The licensing terms are too restrictive for reasonable reuse (e.g. B.1 violation above).'
    - criteria: E.1.2
      comment: 'Given our interpretation of the licensing terms, there is unlikely to be much ability to freely reuse the KEGG FTP data within any class.'
license-commentary:
    - "KEGG (FTP) presents special problems as their licensing depends on variables like academic/non-academic, group/individual, commercial/non-commercial, and location. While the end terms do have some variation, for the sake of convenience, we will act as a non-commercial academic group based in the US wanting to access the entire database. Much curation was then based off of the organizational use agreement: https://www.bioinformatics.jp/docs/subscription_organizational.pdf ."
    - "Given all of the possible use cases, license verbiage, and special conditions, KEGG (FTP) was exceptionally difficult to curate."
    - "Academic users license through NPO Bioinformatics Japan (https://www.bioinformatics.jp/en/keggftp.html)."
    - "Non-academic users license through Pathway Solutions (http://www.pathway.jp/)."
    - "While there are many possible combinations, any individual or use case should have a single license that they will need to get, giving us a pass on A.1."
    - "While we did not go through the registration process, C.1 seems like it would be cleared by the directory layout description on http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/download/ ."
    - "While we did not go through the registration process, C.2 seems like it would be cleared by the implied straighforward FTP access post licensing."
    - 'Also see KEGG API and KEGG REST resources.'
