     comment: The main body of work is under CC-BY 4.0, with filterable additional works under their own terms from KEGG, BioCarta, and AAAS/STKE. While the filtering step is an annoyance, is can likely easily be done given their instructions and would be a one-time process per release.
license-commentary:
    - MSigDB v6.0 is available under a Creative Commons style license, plus additional terms for some gene sets
    - A user must register before being able to view the downloads for tracking purposes. Easy access after that set is done.
