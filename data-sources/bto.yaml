    comment: 'While they are obviously attempting to be permissive by listing \"CC-BY\", this does not map onto any of the number CC-BY versions (e.g. 3.0 or 4.0), thereby, breaking the reference and meaning that we would have to contact for them for terms).'
  - criteria: 'C.2'
    comment: 'Once one knows the location of the BTO (ontology file), access is fine. However, we were unable to locate the ontology file after some searching through the main BRENDA website; most text would imply there is no free ontology file to be had.'
license-commentary:
  - 'The relatively high score is due to knowing where the ontology exists and knowing to look at the header--normal use of the site seems to lead around restricted APIs webpages containing; the free ontology file is hiding in there.'
  - 'Typcial of this is: \"Use of this online version of BRENDA is free for academic research only. Commercial use or download access requires a license. See terms of use.\" (http://bto.brenda-enzymes.org/copy.php)'
  - 'The \"CC-BY\" declaration in the ontology file header should be versioned or linked. Due to not knowing what version, we have marked it as a custom; obviously intended to be under very permissive terms.'
