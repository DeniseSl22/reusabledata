    comment: 'While the linked terms page states that all WikiPathways data is CC0, the \"Redistributing\" states that: \"...you are not allowed to charge for the content it self [sic].\"'
license-commentary:
  - 'In addition to the wording mentioned in the A.2 violation, the same section mentions that you can distribute and charge as long as \"it is made clear that the content is free and freely available from WikiPathways.org.\" Both of these seem to undermine the intent of the CC0 terms.'
