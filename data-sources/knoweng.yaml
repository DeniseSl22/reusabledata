  - 'Evaluation by taking the latter at face value, assuming that it is an encompassing license for all new work, and the remaining requires negotiation with upstream.'
  - 'The major question is whether this is an A.1.1 violation or not; also, whether NC-SA is "restrictive" or "copyleft" for our purposes.'
