description: 'Rhea is an expert curated resource of biochemical reactions designed for the annotation of enzymes and genome-scale metabolic networks and models. Rhea uses the ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology of small molecules to precisely describe reactions participants and their chemical structures. All reactions are balanced for mass and charge and are linked to source literature, metabolic resources and other functional vocabularies such as the enzyme classification of the NC-IUBMB.'
