license-commentary:
    - 'This is apparently not a public data resource: it is consuming open science, but producing nothing for downstream. I have checked the three non-application pages and there is no data, downloads, or copyright beyond software: /, /about, and /methods.'
    - 'From the site: This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data by research groups from all over the world. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions.'
