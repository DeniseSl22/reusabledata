license-commentary:
    - 'While an API is offered through E-Utilities, we will evaluate the more concrete downloads given their ease.'
    - 'Given the nebulous nature of whether or not http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/maintenance_use constitutes a \"custom\" license, we may want to revisit.'
