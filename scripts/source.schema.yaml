  ## (Optional) Setting this flag to true indicates that the licensing
  ## was combinatorially complicated enough (as is the case in some
  ## commercial licenses) that the curator chose to wear a single
  ## "hat" during the process. From the site text:
  ##
  ## "While we try to cover as much of the licensing possibilities of a data
  ## resource that we can, in a few cases we may choose a particular "hat"
  ## to wear while evaluating to prevent a combinatorial explosion, which
  ## may also reduce the clarity of our curations for the community. In
  ## these cases, we may take on the role of a (1) non-commercial (2)
  ## academic (3) group that is (4) based in the US and trying to (5)
  ## create an aggregating resource, noting that other entities may have
  ## different results in the license commentary."

  ## (Optional) Structured issues with the license.
  ## For every issue discovered with a resource, there should be a
  ## corresponding item in the license-issues field that marks the /exact/
  ## violation, along with any comments. This field can be used by
  ## resources as the first step to improvement, as well as clarify any
  ## surrounding circumstances.
  ## Any issues or thoughts about a resource that do not slot into one
  ## of the criteria violations can go into the license-commentary field.
  ##
  ## Example usage:
  ##   "license-issues":
  ##      - criteria: A.1.1
  ##        comment: me no find
  "license-issues":
    type: seq

    sequence:
      - type: str
    required: no
  ## (Optional) Marker noting that there was some extended internal
  ## discussion or controversy about the evaluation of the licensing
  ## terms. If this is marked at "true", the controversy, or a link
  ## to a permanent archive of the controversy, must be sufficiently
  ## contained in the "license-commentary" to reconstruct the issues.
  ##
  ## Example usage:
  ##   "was-controversial": true
  "was-controversial":
    type: str
    required: no
    enum: ["true", "false"]

            required: yes
          ## The URL for grant information.
